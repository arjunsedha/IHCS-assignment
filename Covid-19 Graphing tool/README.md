## Abstract
Upon running various algorithims, the prime subject of debate is which parameters allow sufficient data. For the traversal algorithim, We were unable to supply desired variability due to time constraints and the complexity of our system. 
The final understanding of how a traversal graph will operate is through the admition of the nearest/shortest path based on the decision matrix of the delivery article. Thus eliminating any presuppositions of irrational motivations upon vaccine delivery.

Thank [@inconvergent](https://github.com/inconvergent) for render.py that I somehow edited a bit.
