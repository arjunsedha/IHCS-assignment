<h1 align="center">The problem with Australia's COVID-19 vaccine rollout, and how it can be better</h1>

## 1. Introduction

There has been increasing importance on the role of vaccines and their ability to protect the well-being of society and has also played a historical role in fulfilling the eradication of historic diseases, as to why it is essential that the current COVID-19 vaccines are distributed efficiently to provide long-term protection to populations. The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine has raised concerns to the logistics of vaccines, overall delivery of vaccines, and the prioritisation of vaccinations among the Australian population. This issue will be analysed and understood through a series of models which further conclude in potential solutions.  

## 2. Context
### 2.1. Stakeholders
COVID-19 vaccination rollout programs/systems have differed by country to country, depending on the various circumstances of each. However, in Australia's, case the rollout of a vaccine has been unsuccessful. With PM Scott Morrisson abandoning the national vaccine rollout program on the 12th of April (ABC News, 2021). Thus, causing various elements of the media, academia, and government to look for alternative solutions for an effective vaccine rollout.  

The media is addressing the problem by analyising other vaccine rollout, to see what Australia can learn from them, while also using the opinion of various Australian medical professionals in industry. From example the Guardian published an article listing the best vaccine rollout programs from the world and suggested how Australia can learn from them. While other outlets recognize the problem more as one, which is putting frontline workers at risk (Mirage, 2021)

Industry specialists such as doctors and healthcare professionals view the problem as one not only from ineffective government policy in administering the vaccine but also one that can be blamed on general public's reluctance to get the vaccine. Dr Khorshid the president of the Australian Medical Association stating "Our problem in the past was a lack of vaccines, but just in the last week or so, we've got a new problem and that is Australians have lost confidence in the vaccines." (Zagon, 2021). With some blaming this reluctance on “political overcorrection” (Wolfenden, 2021). 

The stakeholders in this problem could be considered as encompassing the whole of Australia. Considering that it is an issue of public health, which effects everyone. However, the main stakeholders who have a personal stake in this problem being resolved. The first major stakeholder are the state and federal governments. The federal government is InCharge in the rollout of the vaccine and wants to achieve herd immunity as soon as possible. The Government is also desperate for the vaccine to be implemented as the economy has suffered due to measures being taken to stop COVID-19. With Australia experiencing its first recession in 3 decades in 2020 (Janda & Lasker, 2020). This economic downturn due to COVID-19, has also made business a vested stakeholder in the efficient and effective rollout of the vaccine. 

### 2.2. Widely used models
#### SIR model 
The SIR model has long been ***the model*** for epidemiologists, in large part because it can calculate the happenings of an epidemic with only a handful of variables (size of population, infection rate,and recover rate). The model ignores the effects that the response of a population can have, but is still immensely useful as the first step. Because of this, almost everyone has seen the SIR model's infected population "curve", leading to the universal usage of "flatten the curve" at the beginning of the pandemic.

#### Continuous signalling model
As the lockdowns lengthen, the antivax movement gained traction in Australia (Loomes, 2021). Whether the growth and passion of this group is natural or artificial, it has become a problem. This has the potential to become a barrier to herd immunity if the number of antivaxxers get large enough. The signalling model explains why government and public healthcare officials have made numerous statements supporting the efficacy and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines. This, however, may have the opposite effect on people who distrust the government.

### 2.3. Limitations
The Continuous signalling model, employed by political figures to battle the antivax movement, has proven unsucessful (Wolfenden, 2021). The politician's unwillingness to take a harder stance is to blame. By doing less than what they could, and should, the leaders are letting the problem continue, lest they offend their constituents. This can cause even more people to lose confidence in the government, the vaccine rollout, and even the vaccines themselves. If left undealt with, the antivax movement has the potential to become a roadblock to Australia's herd immunity.

Even ignoring the antivax movement, Australia still have many problems to solve in order to reach its target of 200,000 doses-a-day by October. Due to international politics, logistical errors, lack of transparency, and a whole host of other problems, Australia has been slow in delivering vaccine to its citizens. Despite CSL, the local manufacturer of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, ramping up its production capacity, supply has not met demand. Experts have identified manufacturing capabilities as the main bottleneck to immunizing Australians (Sas, 2021).

## 3. Alternative models
### 3.1. Three Models
#### SIR Model
Suceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) mdoels are highly regarded when learning to understand the spread ofa disease. The model allows others to understand the behaviours of individuals in a population and how they react to an epidmemic/pandemic. 

#### Alternate Path Model 
Alternate path models provide an insight on different pathways a process can be carried out to which the most optimal path is chosen. Shortest path algorithms must be calculated which include the logistics of transporting the vaccines to health professionals, then to unvaccinated individuals.  Different pathways will be considered however in the circumstance of COVID-19 and its fast transmission, it is evident that the speed optimisation holds the most importance.   

#### Network Model
Simiar to alternate path models, the cheapest network model will also provide extremely useful in vaccine rollouts and their costs. This includes the costs that apply to the government and individuals. This will further find the most optimal pathway that reduces the overall cost of administering the vaccines. 

### 3.2. Suggested models
#### SIR Model
##### Definition
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SIR model aims to illustrate the number of individuals within a closed population that have either been infected, recovered from infection or are susceptible to infection to which the users are ale to make inferences on the behaviour of a disease. 

##### Premise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The premise of this model is to understand the behaviour of the disease and how the individuals within a population are affected, and how they reacted to it. This is so we can identify any significant behaviours that affect the pandemic outcomes and implement the appropriate strategies in regard to vaccination rollouts. 
 

##### Application
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using this model will require a few assumptions: The rate of increase in the infected is proportional between the contact between the susceptible and infected, and the assumption that the recovery/fatality rates are also constant. The application of this model will also involve a certain closed population that will be categorized in their respective groups according to their disease status (Susceptible, infected, or recovered). An individual can only be in one category at a time. 

##### Required data sources
* The population of each district and city.
* COVID data sets
* Initial number of infected individuals
* Contact, mortality and recovery rate

#### Alternate Path model
##### Definition
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This model will serves the purpose of calculating the the relative speeds between pathways to detrmine the quickest one. It is a Network based system in which values are assigned to nodes and links.

##### Premise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To find the fastest way to administer the vaccine to the nation of Australia. This would imply that the safest way to rid Austria would be the quickest administration of the vaccine. 

##### Application
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The element that will act as a node within the network will be defined by geographical locations that the vaccine must be administered to. These include health clinics, hospitals and pop-up vaccination centres. Since it is difficult to view the entire nation’s worth of clinics and such, we set the system boundary that forces each node to represent its responsible vicinity defined by existing borders between councils. Successfully vaccinating the population of a district takes time. How much time is dependent on the population count and the rate of vaccination. Within this model two more system boundaries will be placed, the first is that the population count of districts will not change and the second being that the rate of vaccination will remain constant. This applies a time value to each node, representing how long it takes to vaccinate that population. Links between these nodes represent the routes of transport. These routes will have assigned to them a time value that defines how long it takes to transport the vaccine. In this model the link’s value will be following time measurement conventions. With the model complete, the fastest route for vaccination can be acquired by a program that uses the many values within the system.

##### Required data sources
* The population of each district and city.
* The estimated average rate of vaccination within districts.
* The estimated travel time of each route of transportation.

#### Cheapest network model
##### Definition
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This model is a lot like the previous APM; however, the major difference is that links between nodes are not predetermined. Instead, these links will be determined by system procedures. 

##### Premise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To construct the most cost-efficient transport strategy for the Covid-19 vaccine.

##### Application
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each node represents the geographical location of clinics, hospitals and any other place where vaccine administration is to take place. Between these nodes will exist many possible links. As such these links are given values that represent cost of transportation between nodes. As such a program will be able to determine the most cost-efficient transport model for the vaccine across Australia.

##### Required data sources
* Estimated cost of transport between points of interest. 

### Summary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These models aid us in attempting to determine the ‘best’ way to ensure the most efficient vaccine rollout in Australia. However, there is room to enhance these systems breaking their system boundaries. Furthermore, it is crucial to understand that no one model represents the ‘best’ possible outcome. Instead, an integration of the three models is required to form a holistic hybrid system that brings the government closer to its goal. A major point to consider when viewing these models is that they all assume an abundance of vaccines which may be the case in reality.
