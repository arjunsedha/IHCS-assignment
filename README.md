<h1 align="center">The problem with Australia's COVID-19 vaccine rollout, and how it can be better</h1>

## 1. Introduction
There has been increasing importance on the role of vaccines and their ability to protect the well-being of society and has also played a historical role in fulfilling the eradication of historic diseases, as to why it is essential that the current COVID-19 vaccines are distributed efficiently to provide long-term protection to populations. The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine has raised concerns to the logistics of vaccines, overall delivery of vaccines, and the prioritisation of vaccinations among the Australian population. This issue will be analysed and understood through a series of models which further conclude in potential solutions.  

## 2. Context
### 2.1. Stakeholders
COVID-19 vaccination rollout programs/systems have differed by country to country, depending on the various circumstances of each. However, in Australia's, case the rollout of a vaccine has been unsuccessful. With PM Scott Morrisson abandoning the national vaccine rollout program on the 12th of April (ABC, 2021). Thus, causing various elements of the media, academia, and government to look for alternative solutions for an effective vaccine rollout.  

The media is addressing the problem by analyising other vaccine rollout, to see what Australia can learn from them, while also using the opinion of various Australian medical professionals in industry. From example the Guardian published an article listing the best vaccine rollout programs from the world and suggested how Australia can learn from them. While other outlets recognize the problem more as one, which is putting frontline workers at risk (Mirage, 2021)

Industry specialists such as doctors and healthcare professionals view the problem as one not only from ineffective government policy in administering the vaccine but also one that can be blamed on general public's reluctance to get the vaccine. Dr Khorshid the president of the Australian Medical Association stating "Our problem in the past was a lack of vaccines, but just in the last week or so, we've got a new problem and that is Australians have lost confidence in the vaccines." (Zagon, 2021). With some blaming this reluctance on “political overcorrection” (Wolfenden, 2021). 

The stakeholders in this problem could be considered as encompassing the whole of Australia. Considering that it is an issue of public health, which effects everyone. However, the main stakeholders who have a personal stake in this problem being resolved. The first major stakeholder are the state and federal governments. The federal government is InCharge in the rollout of the vaccine and wants to achieve herd immunity as soon as possible. The Government is also desperate for the vaccine to be implemented as the economy has suffered due to measures being taken to stop COVID-19. With Australia experiencing its first recession in 3 decades in 2020 (Janda & Lasker, 2020). This economic downturn due to COVID-19, has also made business a vested stakeholder in the efficient and effective rollout of the vaccine. 

### 2.2. Widely used models
#### SIR model 
The SIR model has long been ***the model*** for epidemiologists, in large part because it can calculate the happenings of an epidemic with only a handful of variables (size of population, infection rate,and recover rate). The model ignores the effects that the response of a population can have, but is still immensely useful as the first step. Because of this, almost everyone has seen the SIR model's infected population "curve", leading to the universal usage of "flatten the curve" at the beginning of the pandemic.

#### Continuous signalling model
As the lockdowns lengthen, the antivax movement gained traction in Australia (Loomes, 2021). Whether the growth and passion of this group is natural or artificial, it has become a problem. This has the potential to become a barrier to herd immunity if the number of antivaxxers get large enough. The signalling model explains why government and public healthcare officials have made numerous statements supporting the efficacy and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines. This, however, may have the opposite effect on people who distrust the government.

## 3. Suggested models
### 3.1
#### Agent Based Models
Agent-Based modelling simulates the interactions of “agents” towards other agents and their environment which they are set in, with the consideration of the rules applied to its environment. It allows for the modelling of individual interactions and its often limitless, hence, its fundamental use in understanding complex systems. These models assist in the understanding of different properties and behaviours of agents within dynamic systems (Bonabeau, 2002) and offers a strong representation of real-world situations.  Regarding the COVID-19 vaccines, this model enables for the focus of the efficiency on rollout methods and the dynamic relationships of individuals complex behaviours (Shan & Yang, 2008).  

#### Alternate path model
Alternate path models provide an insight on different pathways a process can be carried out to which the most optimal path is chosen. Shortest path algorithms must be calculated which include the logistics of transporting the vaccines to health professionals, then to unvaccinated individuals.  Different pathways will be considered however in the circumstance of COVID-19 and its fast transmission, it is evident that the speed optimisation holds the most importance.   

Alternate path models will also provide extremely useful in vaccine rollouts and their costs. This includes the costs that apply to the government and individuals. Alternate path modelling will further find the most optimal pathway that reduces the overall cost of administering the vaccines.

*If we need an actual different third model, then we can use the network models – helps us understand how individuals interact with each other e.g., transmission - health professionals are more connected to the public whilst others in rural areas are less likely to come in contact with those in high density populations* 

### 3.2 & 3.3

#### Model 1 - Agent-based modeling

What it is:
	Agent-Based Modelling follows the process of identifying all the various categories of characters within the system. This allows the system thinker to compare differing traits of these characters and depending on their goal, the system analyser can view any issues regarding the link between agents. As such, the system modeler can reposition the links between characters to form the most beneficial system
Premise: 
	The premise behind applying an ABM to successfully analyse the rollout of the covid-19 vaccine is to create a ranking of importance that puts those most at risk of spreading the virus on top and the least at the bottom. This would imply that the safest way to roll out the vaccine is to ensure the minimalization of the virus and protect the health of the Australian community.
How its applied:
	The application of ABM is dependant on 3 major factors. The first 1st is to define who the agents are. In our scenario we will define our agents as the generalised identity of a communal character from any and all sectors of society. This would mean one agent could be the representative nurse, a nurse of all nurses, where another could be the representative trucker. The way these identities will be defined is the 2nd major factor of an ABM. It occurs by first specifying a list of traits that are relevant to our problem but also round enough to provide scope in identity analysis.  An example would be an estimate of their likelihood of contracting the virus on a scale of one to ten where ten means they are certain to contract the virus. Identifying agents in this manner creates a system flaw where the model can only see generalisations, and such will not be able to view an entire country with any accuracy. As such it is valid to create the system boundary that each ABM (there will be many) is specific to each city or council district. This will restrict the variation of these agent identities and increase their accuracy. There must also be a ranking of traits, as decides which agents should be more prioritised for the vaccine. Between these agents there will be links that connect them one and other. The “strength” of each link is dependant on the frequency of contact between the agents. This measurement will allow bad links (links between those with a low chance of survival and those that are highly susceptible) to be prioritised in rollout procedures minimising risk. This entire system allows the system analyser to see which agents are the most ‘influential’ and create the order in which the vaccines should be administered among agents.

Required data sources:
•	The population of each district and city.
•	Occupation populations within districts and cities.
•	An approximation of how often agents come in contact within each district or city.



#### Model 2   - Alternate Paths model

What it is:
This model is similar to ABM in that it will be a network like system. However, the agents within the network will not be subject to ranking through their traits. Instead, only one trait will be considered and the links between these agents.
Premise:
To find the fastest way to administer the vaccine to the nation of Australia. This would imply that the safest way to rid Austria would be the quickest administration of the vaccine.
How it’s applied:
The element that will act as a node within the network will be defined by geographical locations that the vaccine must be administered to. These include health clinics, hospitals and pop-up vaccination centres. Since it is difficult to view the entire nation’s worth of clinics and such, we set the system boundary that forces each node to represent it’s responsible vicinity defined by existing borders between councils. Successfully vaccinating the population of a district takes time. How much time is dependant on the population count and the rate of vaccination. Within this model two more system boundaries will be placed, the first is that the population count of districts will not change and the second being that the rate of vaccination will remain constant. This applies a time value to each node, representing how long it takes to vaccinate that population. Links between these nodes represent the routes of transport. These routes will have assigned to them a time value that defines how long it takes to transport the vaccine. In this model the link’s value will be following time measurement conventions. With the model complete, the fastest route for vaccination can be acquired by a program that uses the many values within the system.

Required data sources:
•	The population of each district and city.
•	The estimated average rate of vaccination within districts.
•	The estimated travel time of each route of transportation.


#### Model 3  - Cheapest network model

What it is:
  This model is a lot like the previous APM; however, the major difference is that links between nodes are not predetermined. Instead, these links will be determined by system procedures.
Premise:
  To construct the most cost-efficient transport strategy for the Covid-19 vaccine.
How it’s applied:
  Each node represents the geographical location of clinics, hospitals and any other place where vaccine administration is to take place. Between these nodes will exist many possible links. As such these links are given values that represent cost of transportation between nodes. As such a program will be able to determine the most cost-efficient transport model for the vaccine across Australia.

Required data sources:
•	Estimated cost of transport between points of interest.
Summary

  These models aid us in attempting to determine the ‘best’ way to ensure the most efficient vaccine rollout in Australia. However, there is room to enhance these systems breaking their system boundaries. Furthermore, it is crucial to understand that no one model represents the ‘best’ possible outcome. Instead, an integration of the three models is required to form a holistic hybrid system that brings the government closer to it’s goal. A major point to consider when viewing these models is that they all assume an abundance of vaccines which may be the case in reality.
